/-! # Citation axioms (authorized by Simon, 2026-07-06)

The current development has exactly one project-level citation axiom beyond
Lean's standard kernel axioms: the AGHP balanced-family existence theorem below.
The VBP endpoint formerly tracked as `vbp_np_hard` has since been discharged in
`NPCC.Wrapper` as a proved reduction package, so it is not declared here or
allowed as a citation axiom. -/

/-- CITATION AXIOM [Alon–Goldreich–Håstad–Peralta 1992, "Simple constructions
of almost k-wise independent random variables"; cited by the paper as
`rem:balanced-columns-exist`]: for all `q ≥ t ≥ 1`, every nonempty finite
alphabet `Y`, and every accuracy `ε ∈ (0,1)`, there is an indexed family of
`q`-tuples over `Y` (repeats allowed and counted — the family is a function
from `Fin L`, not a set) that is `(q,t)`-balanced with accuracy `ε`: for
every coordinate set `J` of size at most `t` and every pattern, the fraction
of family members matching the pattern on `J` deviates from `|Y|^{-|J|}` by
at most `ε · |Y|^{-|J|}`. The family size `L` is bounded by an explicit
polynomial with a single absolute constant `C`, majorizing the paper's
`poly(q) · |Y|^{O(t)} · ε^{-O(1)}`. The paper's deterministic poly-TIME
constructibility claim is deliberately NOT part of this axiom (it belongs to
the Layer-B complexity wrapper). Y lives in `Type` (universe 0) — the weakest
form the development needs. -/
