-- CLAIM-BEGIN aux:Dfamily-singleton
/-- Family complexity of a singleton family collapses to the depth-complexity
of the single induced subgame: `comp{RC} = D (subgame f R C)`. The existential
membership constraint `∃ RC' ∈ {RC}, d = D (subgame f RC'.1 RC'.2)` forces
`RC' = RC`, so the index set is the singleton `{D (subgame f RC.1 RC.2)}` and
`sInf` of a singleton returns its element. -/

-- CLAIM-BEGIN aux:Dfamily-anti-mono
/-- Unit test for `Dfamily`: family complexity is antitone in the family `Φ`.
Enlarging the family of extraction-data pairs can only make the minimum
depth-complexity smaller (more submatrices to choose from). Formally, for
`Φ₁ ⊆ Φ₂` with `Φ₁` nonempty, `Dfamily f Φ₂ ≤ Dfamily f Φ₁`. The cost-set of
`Φ₁` is a nonempty subset of the cost-set of `Φ₂` (each `∃`-witness in `Φ₁`
sits in `Φ₂` via `hsub`), so `Nat.sInf` is antitone: `sInf S₂ ≤ sInf S₁`. The
nonemptiness of `Φ₁` guarantees `sInf S₁` is actually attained (`Nat.sInf_mem`),
placing it inside `S₂` where `Nat.sInf_le` applies. -/
